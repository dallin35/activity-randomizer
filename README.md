# Activity Randomizer

Created By: Dallin Fairbanks

The purpose of this site is to help my wife and I (and anyone else in the Provo/Orem/Utah area) decide what activities to do for dates or fun with free time.

## Application Use

A list of activities are displayed on the right-hand side of the page. If you click the "Random" button in the header the application will highlight and navigate to a random activity.

If you would like to apply filters to the activity list in order to receive more relevant random activity recommendations, you can expand the filter sections on the left-hand section of the application. The application will only make a random activity recommendation based on the activities currently displayed on the right-hand portion of the website.
